## Excel AI Assistant: Transform Data with Natural Language

A Streamlit-powered AI assistant that lets users interact with Excel files using natural language queries. Powered by Google Gemini, it can filter, aggregate, and visualize data based on user input.

# ✨ Features

✅ Natural Language Processing – Ask questions about your Excel data in plain English.

✅ Automated Data Processing – Filter, group, and aggregate data dynamically.

✅ Visualizations – Generate bar charts, histograms, and line plots on demand.

✅ Schema-Aware AI – Gemini understands column names and data types for accurate responses.

✅ Error Handling – Gracefully handles invalid queries and API issues.


# 🚀 How It Works

Upload an Excel file (.xlsx).


Ask a question (e.g., "Show sales by region" or "Plot a histogram of ages").


The app sends the query to Gemini AI, which returns structured instructions.

The backend processes the data and displays results or visualizations.
